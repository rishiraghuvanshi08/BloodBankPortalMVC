Users can be a donor or a person who needs blood. Firstly, users will register on the portal. then if they need blood they can post their requirements. Once the admin verifies their request, They will get blood from the blood bank. And if someone is willing to donate their blood, then they can update this on the portal. Admin will process their request and get it done. 
Coming on the Admin, Admin is the one who manages all the requests of the users and they can see the logs related with the donation and requirements. Admin will verify the requests of the user and will provide them blood units through the blood bank. Admin will update the availability of the blood units also. Also, if someone just needs the blood or wants to donate and they don't want to create an account on the portal, then they can also do so by registering themselves by filling the form on the portal itself.
The project backend is developed on JAVA JSP Servlets and the database used is MySQL. For the frontend we used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 4.
